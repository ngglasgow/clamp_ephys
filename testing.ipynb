    "4. Click `Open Cell`. The plot of your trace open to the current slider value will open.\n",
    "5. The tools pan, wheel_zoom, and crosshair are active by default. You can toggle them on/off with the toolbar on the top of the plot.\n",
    "    - pan: click and drag\n",
    "    - zoom: scroll wheel; if anywhere on plot, will zoom x and y axes; if on x-axis OR y-axis when scroll, will only scroll that axis.\n",

    "    - reset: click to reset to original view\n",
    "6. You can control the sweep displayed with the slider or the left right arrows. \n",
    "7. There is a `drop_list` created when you open the cell which begins as an empty list. Add the displayed sweep the the `drop_list` by clicking `Drop`. If this was a mistake, remove the displayed sweep from `drop_list` by clikcing `undrop`. \n",
    "8. Save `drop_list` to file by clicking the save icon. The saving will be done automatically, and `drop_list` can be read in automatically with code by setting the arg `dropped_sweeps=True` in workflows.cell(). You **MUST** save the `drop_list` before opening a new cell. `drop_list` is always cleared between openings.\n",
    "    - NOTE: the save function will automatically overwrite whatever previously saved dropped sweeps you have for that file. This is useful if you want to redo your drop criteria. This is harmful in the case where you did not want to overwrite your data. Use carefully. "
